    <h1>Module 3: Mitigating Privacy Threats through Security Controls</h1>

  <section class="description">
    <ul>
        <li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security requiring both something you know (password) and something you have (e.g., phone or biometric scan)</li>
        <li>Secure Communication Protocols: Use secure protocols like HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) when browsing websites or sending sensitive info online. </li>
        <li>Regular Updates & Patches: Keep software up to date with updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them!</li>
        <li>Update and upgrade software.
            Who: Director of Information Technology (IT)
            Apply all software updates as soon as they are available. Ideally, you should automate this. Cybercriminals can engineer exploits almost as soon as a patch is released. Many vendors offer update services that can help with automation; just be sure to use updates delivered through protected links and to test them prior to production release. </li>
        <li>Limit and control account access.
            Who: Human Resources (sets policy), Director of IT (executes)
            Threat actors gather account credentials, so it’s recommended that you start your program with a zero-trust framework. Under this model, account privileges are assigned sparingly only as users need them. Have documented procedures for securely resetting credentials or use a privileged access management tool to automate credential management. Also, update your onboarding and offboarding procedures to align with a zero-trust approach.</li>
        <li>Enforce signed software execution policies.
            Who: System Administration
            Your operating system should protect itself using a secure boot—a capability that ensures devices boot using only secure software. To do this, enforce signed software execution policies for scripts, executables, device drivers and system firmware. Allowing unsigned software can give cybercriminals an entry point. </li>
        <li>Actively manage systems and configurations

            Who: IT Administration
            
            Regularly scan and take inventory of your network devices and software. Remove unnecessary or unexpected hardware and software from the network. Such hygiene contributes to cyber risk mitigation by reducing the attack surface and establishing control of the operational environment.</li>
        <li>Hunt for network intrusions

            Who: Security Operations and/or Third-Party Penetration Testers
            
            Operate under the assumption that a compromise has occurred and take proactive measures to detect, contain and remove any malicious presence. Automated tools like endpoint-detection and response solutions should be paired with hunt operations and penetration testing. Such steps can evolve your cybersecurity defence strategies beyond basic detection methods and toward real-time threat detection and remediation.</li>
        <li>Leverage hardware security features.

            Who: System Administration
            
            Contemporary hardware security features built into modern computers can increase system integrity. Schedule older devices for a hardware refresh, or at the least, use an updated operating system on outdated hardware. This can help better protect systems, critical data and user credentials from threat actors.</li>
        <li>Segregate networks using application-aware defences.

            Who: Network Administration
            
            Cybercriminals can hide malicious activity and compromise data over common protocols that transfer data across networks. Application-aware mechanisms, like firewalls, can restrict certain applications if found to be compromised. Start by segregating critical networks and services, then deploying network defences to block improper traffic and restrict content.</li>
        <li>Consider using threat reputation services.

            Who: Third-Party Service
            
            Cyberthreats emerge rapidly, often occurring faster than most organizations are equipped to handle. A third-party threat reputation service takes information globally to detect and correlate threats in real time. This can improve your cyber risk mitigation by increasing coverage of threats, vulnerabilities and trends.</li>
        <li> Leverage multifactor authentication.

            Who: IT Manager/Administration
            
            Multifactor authentication is a necessity for mitigating cyberattacks. Use this protection for accounts with elevated privileges, remote access and/or containing high-value assets. Physical token-based authentication systems should be used to supplement knowledge-based factors such as passwords and PINs.</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party security posture.

            Who: Security Operations
            
            Vendors, third-party suppliers and clients that do business with you present a unique set of security risks. External partners often have access to your organization’s sensitive data or support essential business processes. It’s critical that you continuously monitor third-party risks and properly assess partner cybersecurity plans to help secure your assets.</li>
        <li> Assume insider threats exist.

            Who: Business Operations
            
            Insider threats occur in various forms, ranging from intentional misuse of system access and confidential information to inadvertent errors like clicking on a phishing email. Consider adopting a layered approach for addressing insider threats, including regular assessments and ongoing employee training and awareness campaigns. </li>
