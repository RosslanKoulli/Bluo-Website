    Understanding Security Mechanisms
   </h2>
   
    <p class = "SizeTwentyFont" >
        Information, computer, and network security are essential in today's digital age. Security mechanisms are the tools and techniques used to safeguard information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
    </p>
    <h5>Here are some fundamental security mechanisms that students should be familiar with: </h5>
    <ul >
        <li> Access Control: Access control is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the user's identity, role, or privileges. There are three main types of access control: discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), and role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
        <li>Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. Common authentication methods include passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
        <li>Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting plain text into cipher text, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Encryption is used to protect data in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>Firewalls: Firewalls are network security systems that monitor, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
        <li> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): IDS and IPS are security systems that monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and respond accordingly. IDS detects and alerts security personnel, while IPS detects and prevents malicious activity.</li>
        <li>Malware Protection: Malware protection is the process of detecting and removing malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and Trojans.</li>
        <li>Security Awareness Training: Security awareness training is the process of educating users about security threats and best practices to protect themselves and the organization.</li>
        <li>Vulnerability Management: Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and addressing vulnerabilities in information systems.</li>
        <li>Penetration Testing: Penetration testing is the process of simulating cyber-attacks on an information system to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security controls.</li>
        <li>Incident Response: Incident response is the process of detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. </li>
        <li>Antivirus Software: Antivirus software helps detect and remove malware (bad ware) that could harm your devices or steal your personal info.</li>
        <li>Password Protection: Strong passwords are like strong locks on your digital doors. Use unique combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols to keep intruders out! </li>
    </ul>
